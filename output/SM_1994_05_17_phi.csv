Sarah Mitchell,5/17/1994,"Lately, Iâ€™ve just been feeling really down. Iâ€™m tired all the time, even after sleeping for hours. Iâ€™ve lost interest in the things I used to enjoy like painting or going out with friends. I find myself crying randomly and I just feel hopeless. It's been like this for weeks and Iâ€™m starting to wonder if thereâ€™s something seriously wrong with me.","Based on the clinical context, self-report, and inventory scores, I can provide a preliminary diagnostic impression as follows. Your symptoms of persistent sadness, fatigue, and loss of interest align with criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). The high score on the PHQ-9 indicates that you may be experiencing clinically significant depressive symptoms. However, it's important to note that a comprehensive evaluation by a trained professional is necessary for an accurate diagnosis. I recommend reaching out to your healthcare provider or a mental health specialist who can provide further guidance and support."
